# TikTok Container

**Prevent TikTok from tracking your visits to other websites**

TikTok Container is an add-on you can install on Firefox to prevent TikTok from tracking your activity on other websites, so you can continue to use TikTok while protecting your privacy.

**Note:** To learn more about Containers in general, see [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers).

## Forked from Mozilla's Facebook Container  

This is a lazy fork of [Amazon Container](https://github.com/krober/contain-amazon), which is a fork of Mozilla's [Facebook Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-container/).

## How does TikTok Container work?

The Add-on keeps TikTok in a separate Container to prevent it from following your activity on other websites. When you first install the add-on, it deletes the cookies that TikTok uses to track you on other websites. 

Every time you visit TikTok, it will open in its own container, separate from other websites you visit.  You can login to TikTok within its container.  When browsing outside the container, TikTok won’t be able to easily collect your browsing data and connect it to your TikTok identity.

## How do I enable TikTok Container?

Mozilla has made it easy to take steps to protect your privacy so you can go on with your day.

1. [Install TikTok Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/contain-TikTok/).
2. Log out of TikTok and restart Firefox.
2. Open TikTok and use it like you normally would.  Firefox will automatically switch to the TikTok Container tab for you.
3. If you click on a link to a page outside of TikTok or type in another website in the address bar, Firefox will load them outside of the TikTok Container

## How does this affect TikTok's features?

TikTok Containers prevents TikTok from linking your activity on other websites to your TikTok identity. Therefore, the following will not work:

### Buttons and embedded TikTok content on other websites.

Because you are logged into TikTok only in the Container, buttons and embedded TikTok content on other websites will not work. (Do those even exist?)

## Will this protect me from TikTok completely?

This add-on does not prevent TikTok from mishandling the data it already has or permitted others to obtain about you. TikTok will still have access to everything that you do while you are on TikTok.com or on the TikTok app, including your TikTok shopping history, product reviews, and any data you share with TikTok connected apps, devices, etc.  

Other ad networks may try to link your TikTok activities with your regular browsing. In addition to this add-on, there are other things you can do to maximize your protection, including changing your TikTok settings, using Private Browsing and Tracking Protection, blocking third-party cookies, and/or using [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/ ) extension to further limit tracking.

## How do I use Containers for other websites?

Good news! Containers aren’t just for TikTok. You can use Containers to prevent websites from linking your identities across the Web by installing [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/).

To learn more about how Multi-Account Containers work, see Mozilla's support page at [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/).
